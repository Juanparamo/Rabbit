            <br>Hopping through the forest 
            <br>Scooping up the field mice 
            <br>And bopping them on the head 
            <br>Down came the Good Fairy, and she said 
            <br>"Little bunny Foo Foo 
            <br>I don't want to see you 
            <br>Scooping up the field mice 
            <br>And bopping them on the head."</strong></p>
